     The image cache is used to prevent redownloading of images every time you view an image.  This is especially useful when cells with images are displayed.  Without caching, images would be downloaded every time and casuse "jumpiness" to the scroll of the cells.
     
     - Parameter urlString: the URL of the image represented by a string.  The image is keyed by this value in the cache.
     - Parameter forceDownload: `true` will force the image to be downloaded (even if it is currently in the cache).  The default `false` will check the cache and download the image if it is not in the cache.
